    "description": "This is an H7 series board, touted for \"MPU UIs on an MCU\". It has a 600MHz ARM Cortex-M7 MCU with a memory protection unit. There is an unusually small internal flash and SRAM for such a powerful MCU, but it's compensated by 128MB flash and 32MB PSRAM. A very simple bootloader is needed to jump from the internal flash to the external flash at reset.",
